At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within three business days
(and, typically, one business day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
